# Egg Timer


Egg timer is a tool to measure the time to a perfect boiled egg to suit your taste.

## How it works

1. Select the hardness of your egg as you prefer

- Soft (5 min)
- Medium (7 min)
- Hard (12min)

2. You can also STOP or RESUME whenever you need it!

3. Wait until your egg is done! :)
